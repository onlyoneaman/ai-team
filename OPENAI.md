Built with OpenAI Agents SDK (gpt-4.1). We use the SDK's multi-agent system in a cyclical pattern: sub-agents hand off back to task owners who own deliverables, not just parallel execution. Agents communicate via TaskMessage protocol with structured fields for tasks, results, feedback, and evaluations. Evaluator gates all user-facing output, scoring quality (1-5) before delivery. WebSearchTool enables real-time research. SSE streaming powers live agent visualization. Collaborated with ChatGPT and Codex.
