Problem: Solopreneurs can't afford specialists for every function, yet a single AI lacks focused expertise and quality control for complex tasks.

Soln: TeamAI provides AI employees organized like a real company. A Founder delegates to specialists, who execute and bounce results back. An Evaluator verifies every deliverable before it reaches you.

Unique: Cyclical handoffs with task ownership, not flat agents. TaskMessage protocol for structured communication. Quality gates for consistent output.
