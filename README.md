# TeamAI

Multi-agent marketing automation system built with OpenAI Agents SDK.

A hierarchical AI workforce where a Founder agent orchestrates specialized workers (Marketing Head, Market Researcher, Data Analyst, Evaluator) to handle marketing tasks. Workers use bounce-back handoffs to return results, and user-facing deliverables go through an evaluation cycle for quality assurance.

**Features:** FastAPI + CLI, stateless design, SSE streaming, per-company context, artifact logging.
